This is Line 1: a medium-length sentence to fill the buffer.
Line 2, short.
3: This file must be robust for the 42 evaluation.
4: Four.
5: Five lines, to ensure that BUFFER_SIZE behaves well.
6: The sixth line is big. It is very long indeed, more than 42 bytes, to force several read() calls if the buffer is small, which is fundamental.
7: Seven.
8: Eight, another short line.
9: Line Nine: The penultimate is always an important test.
10: This is the Tenth and LAST LINE. It does not have the newline character at the end.
